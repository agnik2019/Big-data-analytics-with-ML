## BigData - Introduction to Big Data and Data Engineering (Hadoop)
http://www.quuxlabs.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/
It describes how to write mapper and reducer in python for a Hadoop system (a framework for distributed storage, control, retrieval and processing of data). However, without the availability of a Hadoop (which handles shuffle, sort and other relevant job handling processes in distributed settings), I mimic the same using the sort option on a linux system and test the mapper and reducer routines.

# Machine Learning use cases
- *Use Case 1: Predict Apparent temperature* 
predicting the apparent temperature given the humidity.
- *Use Case 2: Predict Fuel Efficiency* 
- *Use Case 3: Predict the person is affected with diabetes or not giving the features ['Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness',
            'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction']* 

To become a  data scientist, we need both **core skills** and **tool skills**.
